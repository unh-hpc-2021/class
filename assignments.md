## Homework assignments

### HW1 (due 2/9 before class)

Finish the following from Class 1:

* Sign up for github, please send me your username.
* Sign up for slack (it's voluntary, though).
* Create a wiki page about yourself (or whatever), use some markdown.

### HW2 (due 2/23 before class)

Do the homework from the Class 4 notes (which involves going part-way back into Class 3). To submit, push your git repository with the work back to github. For the report, a good option for now is to include it, e.g., as `README.md`, as part of the repository. 

### HW3 (due 3/2 before class)

* Do the homework from the Class 6 notes.
* Sign up for a presentation on the Presentations wiki page

### HW4 (due 3/9 before class)

* Finish the bowling game from Class 7, and submit your work on github.
* No need to hand this in at this point, but try to also go through the "Your turn" from Class 8 as far as you can, as we'll continue from there next week.

### HW5 (due 3/16 before class)

* Do the homework from Class 10 -- the first two parts (`vector_add` and `vector_is_equal`) are the regular homework, and the last part, introducing a `struct matrix`, is extra credit.

### HW6 (due 3/23 before class)

* Do the homework from class 12 -- the first part is just writing a report of what happened, for the 2nd part you want to continue the report, but also commit the changes you made to the code.

### HW7 (due 3/30 before class)

* Do the homework from class 14 -- commit your changes and add a report of what the output of the tests was (and why). 

### HW7 (due 3/30 before class)

* Do the in-class exercises / homework from class 16 -- commit your changes and add a report of what timing you got, and whether that matches what you expected. On the last part, `test_integrate` just parallelize the `for` loop and see what happens.
